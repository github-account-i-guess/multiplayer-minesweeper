# multiplayer-minesweeper
Kind of like the minesweeper equivalent to tetrio?
- The basic idea is that 2 people enter a minesweeper game and have different grids
- You can collect point by clearing squares and after you collect X amount of points it will place more mines on your opponent's grid in a random uncleared space
